TIME COURSE TASK:
-----------------

- In the model, check the flag "executable" is set in the Time Course Task.
- Time must be [0,120] minutes (the same as my previous experiments). This should be passed as parameter via the configurator file. Not implemented yet. 
 

PARAMETER SCAN TASK:
--------------------
- Time must be [0,120] minutes (the same as experiments).
- In the model, check the flag "executable" is set in the Parameter Scan Task.
- (REPORT - Name: Parameter Scan Report, Task: Scan).


SENSITIVITIES TASK:
-------------------
Copasi has changed a few times the format for this report. As Sensitivity analysis is not a repetitive task, right now:
- Generate a report for sensitivity analysis. Save this report in PROJECT_FOLDER/simulations/MODEL_NAME/sensitivities/MODEL_NAME_sensitivities.csv
- After running the task, edit the file so that it contains exactly one table.
- Create a configuration file including: 
sensitivities_dir=sensitivities
- The script will generate a plot for each csv file found in the folder `sensitivities`.
