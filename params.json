It aims to automate common processes and speed \r\nup productivity for tasks such as model simulation, single and double \r\nparameter scan, and parameter estimation. \r\n\r\nFor information on how to **install** and **use** SB pipe, please visit \r\nthe \r\n[user manual](https://github.com/pdp10/sbpipe/blob/master/docs/source/user_manual.md).\r\n\r\nFor information on how to **develop** new modules, please visit the\r\n[developer manual](https://github.com/pdp10/sbpipe/blob/master/docs/source/developer_manual.md).\r\n\r\nThese two manuals and the source code documentation are also available \r\nin docs/index.html within the main package folder. \r\n\r\nSB pipe is a relatively young project and there is a chance that some \r\nerror occurs. If this is the case, users should report issues using the \r\nfollowing mailing list: \r\n\r\nsbpipe AT googlegroups.com\r\n\r\nOpen and closed discussions regarding SB pipe can be found in the forum: \r\n\r\n[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sbpipe](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sbpipe)\r\n\r\nTo help us better identify and reproduce your problem, some technical \r\ninformation is needed. These details can be found in SB pipe log files \r\nwhich are stored in ${HOME}/.sbpipe/logs/. If possible, it would be \r\nworth providing this extra information when reporting a bug.\r\n\r\nIssues and feature requests can also be notified using the github issue \r\ntracking system at the web page:\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/pdp10/sbpipe/issues](https://github.com/pdp10/sbpipe/issues)\r\n\r\nThanks for using SB pipe!\r\n",
