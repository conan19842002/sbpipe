TIME COURSE TASK:
-----------------

- In the model, check the flag "executable" is set in the Time Course Task.
- Time must be [0,1440] minutes (the same as experiments).
- Reports must be activated and stored in /home/ariel/tmp/mtor_model_results.csv.
- Simulation type should be stochastic.
 

PARAMETER SCAN TASK:
--------------------
- Time must be [0,1440] minutes (the same as experiments).
- In the model, check the flag "executable" is set in the Parameter Scan Task.
- Reports must be activated and stored in /home/ariel/tmp/mtor_model_results.csv (REPORT - Name: Parameter Scan Report, Task: Scan).
- Simulation type should be stochastic.
- Define the species/reaction rates to scan.
