## How to report bugs or request new features
SBpipe is a relatively young project and there is a chance that some 
error occurs. The following mailing list should be used for general 
questions: 
```
sbpipe AT googlegroups.com
```

All the topics discussed in this mailing list are also available at 
the website: 

[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sbpipe](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sbpipe)


To help us better identify and reproduce your problem, some technical 
information is needed. This detail data can be found in SBpipe log files 
which are stored in ${HOME}/.sbpipe/logs/. When using the mailing list 
above, it would be worth providing this extra information.

Issues and feature requests can also be notified using the github issue 
tracking system for SBpipe at the web page:
