## Issues / Feature requests
SBpipe is a relatively young project and there is a chance that some 
error occurs. Issues and feature requests can be notified using the github issue
tracking system for SBpipe at the web page: [https://github.com/pdp10/sbpipe/issues](https://github.com/pdp10/sbpipe/issues).
To help us better identify and reproduce your problem, some technical
information is needed. This detail data can be found in SBpipe log files
which are stored in ${HOME}/.sbpipe/logs/. When using the mailing list
above, it would be worth providing this extra information.
