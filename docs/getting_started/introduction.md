## Introduction
The rapid growth of the number of mathematical models in Systems Biology fostered the
development of many tools to simulate and analyse them. The reliability and precision
of these tasks often depend on multiple repetitions and they can be optimised if executed
as pipelines. In addition, new formal analyses can be performed on these repeat sequences,
revealing important insights about the accuracy of model predictions.
SBpipe allows users to automatically repeat the tasks of model simulation and parameter estimation,
and extract robustness information from these repeat sequences in a solid and consistent manner,
facilitating model development and analysis.
