## Introduction
This package contains a collection of pipelines for dynamic modelling of biological systems. 
It aims to automate common processes and speed up productivity for tasks such as model simulation, 
single and double parameter scan, and parameter estimation. 


### Requirements
In order to use sb_pipe, the following software must be installed:

- Copasi 4.16 - [http://copasi.org/](http://copasi.org/)
- Python 2.7+ - [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)
- R 3.3.0+ - [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- LaTeX 2013 (optional) [https://latex-project.org/ftp.html](https://latex-project.org/ftp.html)

You should also make sure that the following packages are installed in 
your machine: `python-pip`, and (optionally) `texlive-latex-base`.

Before installing sb_pipe Python and R dependencies the following 
environment variables must be added to your GNU/Linux $HOME/.bashrc file:

```
# SB_PIPE
export SB_PIPE=/path/to/sb_pipe
export PATH=$PATH:${SB_PIPE}/sb_pipe

# Path to CopasiSE
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/CopasiSE
```

The .bashrc file can then be reloaded from your shell using the command: 
```
$ source $HOME/.bashrc
```

On Windows platforms, these environment variables are configured as any other 
Windows environment variable.

Now it is the time to install Python and R packages used by sb_pipe. Two scripts 
are provided to perform these tasks automatically. 

To install sb_pipe Python dependencies, run:
```
cd ${SB_PIPE}/
./install_pydeps.py
```

To install sb_pipe R dependencies, run:
```
cd ${SB_PIPE}/
$ R
# Inside R environment, answer 'y' to install packages locally
> source('install_rdeps.r')
```

If R package dependencies must be compiled, it is worth checking that the following additional packages are installed in your machine: `build-essential`, `liblapack-dev`, `libblas-dev`, `libcairo-dev`, `libssl-dev`, `libcurl4-openssl-dev`. After installing these packages, `install_rdeps.r` must be executed again.


### Installation
Run the command inside the sb_pipe folder: 
```
python setup.py install
```
The correct installation of sb_pipe and its dependencies can be checked by 
running the following commands inside the sb_pipe folder: 
```
cd tests
./test_suite.py
```

## How to use sb_pipe

### Preliminary configuration steps

#### Pipelines using Copasi
Before using these pipelines, a Copasi model must be configured as follow using CopasiUI:

**pipeline: simulate**

- Tick the flag _executable_ in the Time Course Task.
- Select a report template for the Time Course Task.
- Save the report in the same folder with the same name as the model but replacing the extension .cps with .csv.

**pipeline: single or double parameter scan**

- Tick the flag _executable_ in the Parameter Scan Task.
- Select a report template for the Parameter Scan Task.
- Save the report in the same folder with the same name as the model but replacing the extension .cps with .csv.

**pipeline: param-estim**

- Tick the flag _executable_ in the Parameter Estimation Task.
- Select the report template for the Parameter Estimation Task.
- Save the report in the same folder with the same name as the model but replacing the extension .cps with .csv.


### Running sb_pipe
The first step is to create a new project. This can be done with 
the command:
```
run_sb_pipe.py --create-project projectname
```

The previous command generates the following structure:
```
projectname/
    | - Data/
    | - Models/
    | - Working_Folder/
```
Models must be stored in the Models/ folder. The folder Data/ is meant for collecting experimental data files and analyses in one place. Once the data files for Copasi (e.g. for parameter estimation) are generated, **it is advised** to move them into the Models/ folder so that the Copasi (.cps) file and its associated experimental data files are stored in the same folder. To run sb_pipe, users need to create a configuration file 
for each pipeline they intend to run (see next section). These configuration files should be placed in the Working_Folder/. This folder will eventually contain all the results generated by sb_pipe. 

Finally, a pipeline with a certain configuration file can be executed as follows:
```
cd Working_Folder
run_sb_pipe.py pipeline configuration_file
```
where *pipeline* can be one of the following option: 

- --simulate (-s)
- --single-param-scan (-p) 
- --double-param-scan (-d)
- --param-estim (-e)

For additional options, run
```
run_sb_pipe.py --help
```

### Pipeline configuration files
Pipelines are configured using files (here called configuration files). These files are INI files and are therefore structured as follows: 
```
[pipeline_name]
option1=value1
option2=value2
...
```

In sb_pipe each pipeline executes three tasks: data generation, data analysis, and report generation. Each task depends on the previous one. This choice allows user to analyse the same data without having to generate it every time, or to skip the report generation if not wanted. 
Assuming that the configuration files are placed in the Working_Folder of a certain project, examples are given as follow: 

**Example 1:** configuration file for the pipeline *simulate*
```
[simulate]
generate_data=True                # True if data must be generated, False otherwise
analyse_data=True                 # True if data must be analysed, False otherwise
generate_report=True              # True if a report must be generated, False otherwise
project_dir=..                    # The relative path to the project directory (from Working_Folder)
model=insulin_receptor_stoch.cps  # The Copasi model name
cluster=pp                        # The cluster type. pp (parallel python) if the model is executed locally, sge/lsf if executed on cluster.
pp_cpus=7                         # The number of CPU if pp is used, ignored otherwise
runs=40                           # The number of simulations to perform. 1 for deterministic simulations, n>=1 for stochastic simulations.
simulate__xaxis_label=Time [min]  # The label for the x axis.
```

**Example 2:** configuration file for the pipeline *single_param_scan*
```
[single_param_scan]
generate_data=True
analyse_data=True
generate_report=True
project_dir=..
model=insulin_receptor_inhib_scan_IR_beta.cps
scanned_par=IR_beta                            # The variable to scan (as set in Copasi Parameter Scan Task)
simulate__intervals=100                        # The number of intervals in the simulation
simulate__xaxis_label=Time [min]
single_param_scan_simulations_number=1         # The number of simulations to perform for each scan
single_param_scan_knock_down_only=True         # True if the variable is only reduced (knock down), False if over expression is also considered.
single_param_scan_percent_levels=True          # True if the scanning represents percent levels.
min_level=0                                    # The minimum level (as set in Copasi Parameter Scan Task)
max_level=100                                  # The maximum level (as set in Copasi Parameter Scan Task)
levels_number=10                               # The number of scans (as set in Copasi Parameter Scan Task)
homogeneous_lines=False                        # True if the plot lines should not distinguish between scans (e.g. full lines with the same colour)
```

**Example 3:** configuration file for the pipeline *double_param_scan*
```
[double_param_scan]
generate_data=True
analyse_data=True
generate_report=True
project_dir=..
model=insulin_receptor_inhib_dbl_scan_InsulinPercent__IRbetaPercent.cps
scanned_par1=InsulinPercent                                              # The 1st variable to scan (as set in Copasi Parameter Scan Task)
scanned_par2=IRbetaPercent                                               # The 2nd variable to scan (as set in Copasi Parameter Scan Task)
sim_length=10                                                            # The length of the simulation (as set in Copasi Time Course Task)
```

**Example 4:** configuration file for the pipeline *param_estim*
```
[param_estim]
generate_data=True
analyse_data=True
generate_report=True
generate_tarball=True
project_dir=..
model=insulin_receptor_param_estim.cps
cluster=pp
pp_cpus=7
round=1                                  # The parameter estimation round which is used to distinguish phases of parameter estimations when parameters cannot be estimated at the same time
runs=40                                  # The number of parameter estimations (the length of the fit sequence)
best_fits_percent=75                     # The threshold percentage of the best fits to consider
data_point_num=33                        # The number of available data points 
plot_2d_66_95cl_corr=True                # True if 2D all fits plots for 66% and 95% confidence levels should be plotted. This is computationally expensive.
logspace=True                            # True if parameter values should plotted in log space.
```
